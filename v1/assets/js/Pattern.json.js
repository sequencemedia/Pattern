Debt Clearance Plan","promoIconBeta":"","productOverview":"One of the usual reasons why people apply for a personal loan is to clear their debt. Credit cards, mortgage, and other bills and financial obligations would sometimes pile up, earn interest, and become increasingly difficult to pay off as time goes on. This is why sometimes, it’s best to take out a loan to pay off all the existing debt and consolidate the payment into one firm. This is how Promise (HK)’s Debt Clearance Plan works. For a maximum loan of HKD 600,000, the Debt Clearance Plan’s lowest monthly flat rate is at 0.7%. With a repayment period of 12 months, the annual percentage rate (APR) clocks in at just 16.26%. If you take out a loan of the minimum HKD100,000, that’s a total repayment of HKD 108,400, at a monthly rate of HKD 9,033. What’s more, you don’t need a collateral to apply for a loan—the interest might be slightly higher because of the unsecured loan, but at least you can enjoy a worry-free loan that will help you clear out your debts.
